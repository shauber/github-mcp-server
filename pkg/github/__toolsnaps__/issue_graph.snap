  "description": "Get a graph representation of an issue or pull request and its related issues/PRs.\n\nThis tool helps understand the relationships between issues and PRs in a repository, especially useful for:\n- Understanding the scope of work for an issue or PR\n- Planning implementation for a task that's part of a larger epic\n- Identifying blockers or dependencies\n- Finding related work that might conflict or overlap\n- Understanding why a piece of work exists (tracing to parent epic)\n\nThe graph shows:\n- Node types: epic (large initiatives), batch (parent issues), task (regular issues), pr (pull requests)\n- Parent/child relationships from sub-issues and \"closes/fixes\" references\n- Related issues mentioned in bodies\n\nCall this tool early when working on an issue to gather appropriate context about the work hierarchy.\n\nWorks well with:\n- issue_read: After using issue_graph to identify important related issues, use issue_read to get full details of specific issues\n- pull_request_read: Use to get full PR details for PRs identified in the graph\n- search_issues: If the graph reveals related work areas, search for more issues in those areas\n- list_issues: List all issues in the repository to find additional context not captured in the graph",
